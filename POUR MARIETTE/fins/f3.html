    <p>The monster fell to the ground and disappeared. I smiled softly, a hand landing on my head and my hat falling to the ground. I looked above me and saw Bunny, looking a little prouder than usual. Then, as if wings had grown from my back like all those beautiful poems, a purple snowflake floated above my head.</p>
