    <p> After answering "yes" to his last, peculiar question, I close my eyes in sudden tiredness and a warmth envelops me. I think back on my life, his questions, this strange but comforting world. "Do I accept real life, in its worst and best moments?" It sounds like an unhappy marriage...but I can't push it away forever, so yes.</p>
    <p></p>

    <p> As I stand up, something falls to the floor. I pick it up curiously and, looking at it, smile sadly. A hair clip in the shape of a deer.</p>
