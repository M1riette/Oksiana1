    <p>The giant eye led me into a much darker world, full of blurry things or hidden behind enormous rocks, as if they were secrets. I advance blindly, still as scared but more lucid than at the beginning. This world may not be so real, as Kaf... no, the cockroach said.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>The further I go, the more I feel like I recognize parts of myself, memories. A "Mom!" shouted here, a laugh echoing there... then the further I go, the less joyful it is. It's more like sighs, tears, and disappointment. I see forgotten skates on the side.</p>

    <p>Hey...that reminds me that I loved the ice rink when I was little, I even wanted to become a pro! But school took up all my time and the passion slowly faded, to the point of ending up here...</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>This revelation gave me an electric shock, and I suddenly woke up. I was in an office, nothing more normal. Before me was the monster who had spoken to me at the fountain, claiming I had no place in this delirious, colorful world. But, squinting, I saw only a psychologist, grinning proudly.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>I'm back.</p>
