    <p> "Do I accept real life, in its worst and best moments?" It sounds like an unhappy marriage...no, I don't want one. This gray-tinted world depresses me...and yet, it's mine.</p>
    <p>I close my eyes and a sudden chill takes hold of me, reminding me of what temperature was like, nonexistent in this delirious world. When I open them again, the colors have disappeared from before me. Above me, pink, yellow, and blue blend together, and below me, green, brown, and gray behave the same way. But the surfaces no longer exist.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>How strange...</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>A voice sounds in my head or around me, the same as that of this strange quiz.</p>
   <p></p>
   <p>"Your uncertainty will be your downfall. Stay here until you understand. Until you understand yourself."</p>
   <p></p>
   <p>So I waited for I don't know how long, the word no longer having any meaning. The only thing that accompanied me in this floating sphere was the incessant remarks of this voice that tried to explain my mental state to me.</p>
