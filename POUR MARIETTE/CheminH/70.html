    <p> Oksiana, scared of the bunny, decided to run again and flee in the opposite direction. She's passing by a strange place with giant watermelon planted in a yellow sugar-looking ground. There is a direction sign in the middle. She saw "Garden of peace" and didn't think twice, running there.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p> She meets a giant cockroach, everything is 
disproportionate here... </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>He saw her approaching, looking at him weirdly, instantly, he started to cry.</p>
    <p>"Why are you looking at me like that ? I didn't choose this body...I woke up one day like that ! Stop looking at me like that..here, take an apple and go away." He gives her an apple</p>
